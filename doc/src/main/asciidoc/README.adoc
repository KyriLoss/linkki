A data binding framework for web based user interfaces with https://vaadin.com/home[Vaadin].

== Features

Commonly applications consist of a variety of input elements that closely mirror objects and properties of a domain model. Creating such user interfaces and implementing the synchronization with the domain model is often a repetitive task. *linkki* automates most of the data binding tasks, enabling developers to focus on the domain- and UI logic.

* Fast UI development
* Declarative UI definition (with annotations)
* UI logic implementation using the presentation model pattern (PMO)
* automatic data binding between (P)MO and UI elements
* dynamic binding of other UI properties, including
** visibility
** enabled-state
** list of available values
