== Creation Of A UI With linkki

*linkki* offers two ways to create a UI:

1. <<pmo-uisection, via `@UISection` on the PMO>>
2. <<manual-binding, manual binding via `@Bind`>>

In the first case a so called _Section_ is generated, in which UI elements are arranged. The second option leaves the creation of UI elements entirely to the developer.
