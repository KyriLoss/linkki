== UI Components


During the <<pmo-uisection,creation of UIs with @UISection>> UI components are not defined directly, they are declared via annotations on the PMO properties instead. Later they are generated from the annotations by *linkki* and inserted in a UISection.

*linkki* offers ready-to-use annotations for the most common UI components, which generate standard Vaadin elements or custom subclasses depending on the data type. These are prefixed with "UI".

These UI components can be divided in two groups: <<ui-field, fields>> and <<ui-button, buttons>>. Using the annotation <<tooltips, `@UITooltip`>>, tooltips can be bound to these components. Additionally *linkki* allows for the creation of <<ui-container-pmo, tables>>.
