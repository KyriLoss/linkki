=== Goal

The goal is to create a simple user interface for reporting errors. The report should have a description and a type. The following types should be available:

* Bug
* Improvement
* Question

The report can only be submitted if a description has been entered and a type was selected.

image::{images}{images-folder-name}/report_enabled.png[]

NOTE: Persisting the report is *not* part of this tutorial.

=== Prerequisites

To start this project, follow the steps described in <<project-setup, project setup>>.

=== Step 1: Model
First we implement the 'DomainModel'. The model consists of two classes, <<report, `Report`>> and <<report-type, `ReportType`>>. These classes do _not_ receive UI specific annotations.

[[report]]
[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/model/Report.java[tags=report]

    // getters and setters
}
----

[[report-type]]
[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/model/ReportType.java[tags=report-type]
----
NOTE: `ReportType` implements the method `getName()`. This method is called by *linkki* to display the 'caption' for the enum values.

=== Step 2: PresentationObjectModel (PMO)

Our UI shall receive a text area for the entry of a description. For the selection of the report type a ComboBox with the enum constants of the `ReportType` shall be displayed. To submit the report we also require a `Send` button. It shall only be active if a description has been entered and a type was selected.

Now we create a new class in the package `org.linkki.samples.gettingstarted.pmo`, naming it `ReportSectionPmo`. Of importance is the `@UISection` annotation on the class.

The class has an instance variable, the <<report, `Report`>>, which must be passed to the constructor.

[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/pmo/ReportSectionPmo.java[tags=report-pmo]

    ...
----

For the model binding to work, a method must be created and annotated with `@ModelObject`.

[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/pmo/ReportSectionPmo.java[tags=model-binding]
----

Now the TextArea and the ComboBox are defined. Again, for each a method must be created, annotated with `@UITextArea` and `@UIComboBox`, respectively.

[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/pmo/ReportSectionPmo.java[tags=textfield]

include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/pmo/ReportSectionPmo.java[tags=combobox]
----

NOTE: If the methods have the same name as the fields in the domain model, the property `modelAttribute` can be omitted.

IMPORTANT: The annotations must always be added to the methods, not the fields of the class.

The last step is the definition of the button. As a special feature, the button shall be activated or not depending on values in the model. This is determined via the property `enabled = EnabledType.DYNAMIC`.

By setting `EnabledType.DYNAMIC`, *linkki* searches for a method `boolean isSendEnabled()`. It is called automatically during the update of the UI. Its return value determines the activation state of the button.

IMPORTANT: The method name _must_ conform to the convention is[NameOfThePropertyBelongingToTheAnnotatedMethod]Enabled(). The method must be public and return a boolean value.

include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/pmo/ReportSectionPmo.java[tags=button]
----

=== Step 3: Vaadin UI

The UI contains 'only' the section for the creation of the report.

The first part is 'normal' Vaadin code. The interesting *linkki* parts start at line 9. First a `PmoBasedSectionFactory` is instantiated. The PMO is passed as parameter to the method `createSection`. As second parameter a `BindingContext` is passed -> it is explained in the later chapters. As the last step the created `section` must now be set as `content` of the UI.

[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{source-dir}/org/linkki/samples/gettingstarted/GettingStartedUI.java[tags=ui-class]
----

=== Step 4: web.xml

The application must be made known to the application server. It expects a `web.xml`, in which our UI is started with the `VaadinServlet`.

[source,xml]
----
include::{source-dir}/../webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[]
----

=== Starting the Application

The application can be started from the command line via

[source,bash]
----
$> mvn clean install tomee:run
----

and is then reachable at http://localhost:8080/linkki-getting-started.
