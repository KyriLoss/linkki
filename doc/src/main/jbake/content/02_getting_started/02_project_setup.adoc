=== Project Setup

==== Prerequisites

To start this project, you need

 * Java 8
 * your favourite Java IDE
 * Maven
 * a modern browser
 
==== Maven

Apart from *linkki* we require Vaadin as dependency:

[source,xml]
----
include::{base-dir}/pom.xml[]
----

In the above example, we are creating a web application that is packaged as `war`, as it is needed for the <<linkki-example, linkki example>>.

==== Null analysis

linkki uses https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jdt/org.eclipse.jdt.annotation[Eclipse JDT Annotations] for null analysis.  If linkki classes are extended (like `ContainerPmo` for tables), this dependency has to be added in order to compile correctly:

[source,xml]
----
include::{tree-sample-dir}/pom.xml[tags=eclipse-annotations]
----
