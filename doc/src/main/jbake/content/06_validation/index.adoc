*linkki* comes with built-in support for basic validation. Every <<binding-basics,BindingManager>> contains a <<validation-service,ValidationService>> that it calls after every update. The validation messages returned by that service are then matched with the bound components via the names of their properties. If a message matches, the according UI component is marked automatically.
