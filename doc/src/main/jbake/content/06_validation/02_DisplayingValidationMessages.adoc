=== Displaying Validation Messages

By default *linkki* provides no UI element for displaying validation messages returned by a `ValidationService`. In order to display these messages a custom UI component has to be created along with a `BindingManager`. The `BindingManager` must override its `updateMessages` method that gets called after validation. A common pattern here is to use a `Consumer<MessageList>` as an argument to the `BindingManager` to decouple it from the actual custom UI component (which implements `Consumer<MessageList>`).
