=== Binding, BindingContext, BindingManager

For each UI component bound to a PMO, *linkki* creates a so called `binding`. The methods of this `binding` ensure that subsequent changes in the PMO lead to an update of the UI component.

All bindings in *linkki* are part of a `BindingContext`. Typically a `BindingContext` contains all bindings of a page or a section with independent content. Changes to a bound object (PMO or UI) trigger an update of all bindings in the same context. Multiple PMOs can be bound to the same `BindingContext`.

.BindingContext and ~Manager

To create and manage one or more `BindingContexts`, a `BindingManager` is used. For a given name (for instance derived from a class) it returns a `BindingContext`, creating a new one when necessary. The desired binding behavior can be defined in subclasses of `BindingManager` (see <<cross-sectional-binding,Vertical Binding>>). If no special behavior needs to be implemented, a `DefaultBindingManager` can be used. A `BindingManager` is typically created `@ViewScoped` and passed to each `Page` (see <<missing-link,Page>>).

`DialogBindingManager` is a special `BindingManager`, which triggers a validation method for each change of the dialog.
