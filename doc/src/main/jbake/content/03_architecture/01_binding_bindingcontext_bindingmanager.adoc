=== Binding, BindingContext, BindingManager

For each UI component bound to a PMO, *linkki* creates a so called `binding`. The methods of this `binding` ensure that subsequent changes in the PMO lead to an update of the UI component.

All bindings in *linkki* are part of a `BindingContext`. Typically a `BindingContext` contains all bindings of a page or a section with independent content. Changes to a bound object (PMO or UI) trigger an update of all bindings in the same context. Multiple PMOs can be bound to the same `BindingContext`.

To create and manage one or more `BindingContexts`, a `BindingManager` is used. For a given name (for instance derived from a class) it returns a `BindingContext`, creating a new one when necessary. The desired binding behavior can be defined in subclasses of `BindingManager` (see <<cross-sectional-binding,Vertical Binding>>). If no special behavior needs to be implemented, a `DefaultBindingManager` can be used.

==== The Scope of UI Updates

A `BindingContext` ensures that all fields bound to it get updated if one of them changes. Thus a BindingContext defines the "scope" of UI updates for it's fields.

It is common practice to use a BindingContext for all fields visible to the user at a time. For example a single binding context for a big form. On the other hand, if there are multiple tab sheets it's best to use a separate binding context for each of them, as only one of the tabs is visible at a time. This also avoids unnecessary updates of fields that aren't even visible.

The `BindingManager` is responsible for everything that is beyond that aspect of currently visible fields. For example the input of data on one tab sheet may result in a validation violation on another tab sheet. Hence <<validation,validation>> is part of the `BindingManager`.
