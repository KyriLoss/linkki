== Architecture

Central aspects of the *linkki* Frameworks are

* the declarative definition of UIs via annotations
* the flexible data binding

*linkki* enables a declarative definition of UIs, by generating them automatically from annotations. Additionally, content (data) of an UI element and its properties (for instance visibility, editability, ...) can be bound to so called Presentation Model Objects (PMOs). With this, a bi-directional update mechanisms is provided, the so called data binding. If a value is changed on the UI by a user, for instance, the corresponding value in the domain model ist updated, as well as dependent properties and other UI elements.

In the first part of this chapter the <<grundaufbau-binding, `BindingContext` and `BindingManager` basics>>, and how they interact, are detailed.

Further on, <<databinding, Data binding with PMOs>> is explained. These can be simple PMOs, in which values are stored, or <<domain-model-binding, PMOs with domain model binding>>, where values are bound directly to the domain model. The binding of <<modell-attribut-namen, multiple model objects>> in a PMO is also explained.

Which properties of the defined UI elements can be controlled and which possibilities *linkki* provides, is discussed in the section <<binding-ui-element-properties, Binding of further UI element properties>>.

The chapter concludes with <<querschnittsaspekte-im-binding,Cross-Sectional Data Binding>>.
