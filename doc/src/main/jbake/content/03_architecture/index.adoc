[[Architecture]]
== Architecture

Central aspects of the *linkki* Frameworks are

* the declarative definition of UIs via annotations
* the flexible data binding

In the first part of this chapter the <<binding-basics, `BindingContext` and `BindingManager` basics>>, and how they interact, are detailed.

Further on, <<databinding, Data binding with PMOs>> is explained. These can be simple PMOs, in which values are stored, or <<domain-model-binding, PMOs with domain model binding>>, where values are bound directly to the domain model. The binding of <<model-attribute-names, multiple model objects>> in a PMO is also explained.

Which properties of the defined UI elements can be controlled and which possibilities *linkki* provides, is discussed in the section <<binding-ui-element-properties, Binding of further UI element properties>>.

The chapter concludes with <<cross-sectional-binding,Cross-Sectional Data Binding>>.
