== Application Framework

Next to the binding abilities *linkki* provides a set of useful components that could be used to build business enterprise applications.

To use the application framework you need to add an additional dependency, the version should be the same as for *linkki*.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.linkki-framework</groupId>
            <artifactId>linkki-application-framework</artifactId>
        </dependency>

The use of the application framework is optional.
