=== UI

To create a Vaadin application you need to subclass `UI`. Using the *linkki application framework* you get a default implementation called `LinkkiUi` which handles the ui setup. The actual UI implementation is configured
in your servlet using `@VaadinServletConfiguration`. To provide some views you could simply subclass `LinkkiUi` and use the `addView(...)` method or `addProvider(ViewProvider)`(for example with Vaadin's CDIViewProvider) as you need. The `LinkkiUi` uses the `ApplicationConfig` which could be implemented for your needs.

You can see an example in our `ApplicationSampleUI`

=== Application Configuration

The main aspects of the application are configured using the `ApplicationConfig`. This interface needs to be
implemented once in every *linkki* application and provided to the `LinkkiUi`. Next to some constants like name and version it configures the following parts:

  * The application layout which is the main UI component and contains the current view
  * The application navigator which is used to navigate from one view to another
  * Possible converters to convert values between UI and underlying model


=== Components

The *linkki* application framework contains the following components.

==== Application Layout

The application framework includes an `ApplicationLayout` that surrounds the main view with an `ApplicationHeader` and `ApplicationFooter`. The header is designed to have multiple menu actions on the left and may have some specific items like help menu or preferences on the right side.

The footer simply contains some application info but could be extended to fit your needs.

Between `ApplicationHeader` and `ApplicationFooter` is the main area that displays your current `View`.

The `ApplicationLayout` is created using  the `ApplicationConfig`'s `createApplicationLayout()` method, which by default includes an `ApplicationHeader`(created using `getHeaderDefinition()`) with an `ApplicationMenu` containing all items provided by `getMenuItemDefinitions()` and an `ApplicationFooter` created using `getFooterDefinition()`.


==== Application Navigator

The `ApplicationNavigator` is a subclass of vaadin's `Navigator` that has some convenience methods for initialization and navigation. It is instantiated by the `ApplicationConfig`. The navigator handles the different views and instructs the `ApplicationLayout` to show the view in the main area.

==== Sidebar Layout

The `SidebarLayout` is a UI component that gives access to several different views.

On the left there is a horizontal bar containing icons (buttons) for every sheet. The tooltip of the button displays the name of the corresponding sheet. The content of the selected sheet is displayed to the right of the bar.

In order to create a sidebar instantiate the `SidebarLayout` and add `SidebarSheets`. Every sheet requires an icon, a name and a content. It is also possible to provide a `Supplier<Component>` that is called when the sheet is selected for the first time (lazy initialization). This approach is useful if the creation of the content is more complex and/or if the sheet might be rarely visible.

Additionally you can supply a `UiUpdateOberser` that is triggered every time the sheet is selected. Use this observer to update your binding context in case of changes to the underlying model while the sheet was invisible. Our sample application contains a sidebar layout with two sheets that highlights the utility of that approach. The second sheet displays a list of reports which are created on the first sheet. Thus the second sheet needs to be updated every time it is selected because the underlying data might have changed in the meantime.

==== Headline

For every sheet it is useful to have a headline that describes the current content. It natively has a headline caption and could be extended by subclasses.

To use a `Headline` simply instantiate and add the component to your content.

If you want the Headline's title to be updated dynamically, you can also bind it to a PMO. To do so, create a PMO containing a corresponding getter method for `Headline#HEADER_TITLE`:

include::{source-dir-application}/org/linkki/samples/appsample/pmo/HeadlinePmo.java[tags=HeadlinePmo]

Then bind it with the headline:
