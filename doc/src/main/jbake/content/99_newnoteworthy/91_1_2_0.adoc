==== Buttons and Arbitrary UI Elements in Section Headers

Using the annotation <<section-header-annotation,@SectionHeader>>, any UI element can now be added to a section's header instead of its content area. This should be used instead of a button PMO returned from `PresentationModelObject#getEditButtonPmo()`.

==== Radio Buttons

Vaadin's radio button group, previously only used as an <<custom-ui-element-annotation,example how to create a custom UI element>>, is now also a part of linkki for Vaadin 8 with the <<ui-radiobutton,`@UIRadioButtons`>> annotation.
