==== New Kind of Section: @UIFormSection

In this version, we introduce a new section annotation: `@UIFormSection`.

`@UISection` is the most commonly used layout component when using *linkki*. It is characterized by its prominent header, which is followed by elements ordered as a form. While being very useful for most cases, it also brings some problems, both technical as well as practical. The new `@UIFormSection` offers a similar layout while tackling some of the known deficits.

Consistent Alignment:: One of the most frequent complaints about `@UISection` is the inconsistent alignment across different sections. This is due to the fact that the labels are always as wide as the longest label in a `@UISection`. `@UIFormSection` uses the same label width for all sections, resulting in nicely aligned lables and fields.

Flexible Styling with CSS:: On the more technical side, `@UISection` creates a `GridLayout` in which all sizes are calculated by javascript and set as inline style. As a consequence, it is almost impossible to change sizes such as the label width with CSS. In contrary, `@UIFormSection` uses a `FormLayout` which is mostly styled with CSS. +
As a direct implication, the label width in the `@UIFormSection` can be easily changed with CSS as explained in the <<formsection-label-width, documentation of @UIFormSection>>.

Line Break of Longer Labels:: Due to the length of labels being limited, labels that exceed the length will be <<formsection-label-width, broken into multiple lines>>. Consider rewording them to make them shorter, or increasing the label size.

Single Column Layout:: `@UIFormSection` does not yet offer multi column layout. If the columns address different domain objects, consider creating two separate sections that are placed in a horizontal layout. If you are currently using a multicolumn section, please contact us to tell us your use case. To do so, please create a feature request on the https://github.com/linkki-framework/linkki[linkki Github page] or mailto:info@faktorzehn.de[contact us directly]. Thank you very much!

Converting Sections to the new @UIFormSection:: In most cases you can directly change the annotation of your PMO class from `@UISection` to `@UIFormSection`. 
_Caveat:_ Sections that make use of the `columns` attribute as well as any PMO classes that implement the `ContainerPmo` interface (i.e. `TableSections`) have to continue using the `@UISection` Annotation.

==== Section Labels Are Now Right Aligned

All labels inside a section are now right aligned by default. A right alignment makes sure that the label and the matching input control are always visually close. In case the length of the labels vary strongly in a section, left alignment can make a label appear far away from the input control itself. This can make the form look less ordered as the affiliation between the label and the input control is broken visually.

If you want to keep the left alignment, define the following variable value in your SCSS theme before importing `linkki.scss`:

[source,css]
----
$linkki-caption-alignment: left;
