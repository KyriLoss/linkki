[[layout]]
=== Layouts

*linkki* provides some standard layout annotations which are described here. If you need another layout it is quite easy to <<custom-ui-layout-annotation,create custom layout annotations>>.

[[layout-section]]
==== Section

A group of input fields is called _section_. A section usually has a descriptive title defined by the `caption` attribute. A line in the title bar visually separates the title from the content. Without a title, a section is not directly recognizable as such, but looks like a simple layout. Instead of input fields, the content can also consist of a table.

The section layout is defined by annotating a PMO with the annotation `@UISection`.

The section may be closable that means its content can be collapsed to give a better overview about the whole page. Simply configure this feature using the annotation attribute `closeable`.

The layout for all the components within the section can be defined with the attribute `layout`. *linkki* defines the possible layouts in the enum `SectionLayout`: HORIZONTAL, COLUMN or CUSTOM.

If a section contains a table instead of multiple input fields it is called _TableSection_.

[[horizontal-section-layout]]
===== Horizontal Section Layout

With the horizontal layout all input fields are displayed on a line, side by side in the order of their position. The attribute `columns` is ignored.

[[column-section-layout]]
===== Column Section Layout

With the column layout fields are displayed one below the other. If additionally a number of columns are defined with the property `columns`, a kind of grid layout is produced. The grid is filled in the order of the field's position from left to right, row by row. 

[[custom-section-layout]]
===== Custom Section Layout

Custom layout does not directly define the layout but gives the ability to create a HTML file containing the exact position of each control. Therefore it uses the https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/layout/layout-customlayout.html[CustomLayout] from Vaadin.

All you have to do is to create a HTML file located in the `layouts` folder in your theme folder. The HTML file has to be named with the simple name of your PMO and use the file extension `.html`. Within this HTML file you use `<div location="...">` elements as placeholder for every component. Within the `location` attribute you use the PMO property name to reference the component as needed. If you also want to have the placeholder for the PMO defined label you simply use the PMO property name with the suffix `-label`. In the PMO there are no restrictions. The position will be ignored, as it is determined by the HTML template.

In this sample there is a simple address input section.

The relevant code for the class declaration and a part of the field declarations are given in this code snippet.

The corresponding part of the html file may looks like this. The used css classes are not part of the default stylesheet.

===== Button in Section Header

Sometimes it is useful to have a button in the sections header, for example to open a special edit dialog. This can be achieved by implementing the interface `PresentationModelObject` with the method `getEditButtonPmo()`. The returned `ButtonPmo` defines the button and its behavior.

==== Simple Vaadin Layouts

Beside the section there are some simple Vaadin layouts that can be created with the corresponding annotations:

 * @UIHorizontalLayout
 * @UIVerticalLayout
 * @UIFormLayout

Some of these annotations may have special parameters to configure the alignment of the contained components.

TIP: To create the UI from a PMO with these layouts you should use `VaadinUiCreator`. The `PmoBasedSectionFactory` is only usable for `@UISection` whereas the `VaadinUiCreator` could be used for all kinds of layouts.


[[section-id]]
==== SectionID

Each HTML element of a layout may define an ID. This can be used, for instance, to identify a section for UI testing. By default the simple name of the class is used as the ID. Alternatively the annotation '@SectionID' can be used to specify a method that returns the ID for the section.

A method annotated with '@SectionID' is called by *linkki* when the section is created. The ID remains the same for the duration of the session and is not updated dynamically.

To access the section ID, the helper method `Sections.getSectionId(Object)` may be used.

NOTE: Although the concept is named _SectionID_ it is also applied to all kinds of layouts.
