== New & Noteworthy

=== Captions for Checkboxes

*linkki* versions up to 0.9.20171123 treated checkboxes like any other input field, with a preceding label. But in most UI layouts, checkboxes are followed by a caption instead. To facilitate this layout, the `@UICheckBox` now has a `caption` property that must be set. The old `label` can still be used, but the default value for `noLabel` has been switched to `true`, so that `nolabel=false` has to be used where a label should be displayed.
 
Where a `@UICheckBox` is used in a table column, the label (if `nolabel=false` is set) is displayed in the column header, while the caption remains with the individual checkboxes in the table cells.
